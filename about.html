<h6>Who Are We?</h6>
<p>Our Parent Company, Maa Kali Trading Co. was founded in 2003, a decade into the independent India. It was born out of a love for tea & spices and the desire to share the perfect cuppa with the millions of people in the country. The Company was registered with the Kolkate, Siliguri and Guwahati Tea Auction Centers in India which are the main industrial hubs of the North. Furthermore, we became the registered brokers of the tow largest production houses namely, Goodricke Group Limited and McLeod Russell Limited, working to make their teas & spices available to all small and big buyers within the country. After making our mark in the domestic markets, in 2013, we decided to take this endeavor to the International market and that is how Maa Kali Trading Co. was born. We have already made our foray into the USA, Middle East and Russian markets among others. </p>

  <h6>What Do We Do?</h6>
  <p>Every region has a unique way of consuming tea & spices and hence, our teas are sourced from various auction centers and even small producers to create blends that are tailor-made to your needs. We guarantee 100% consistency in our blends by carrying out an extremely extensive tasting session to ensure the character and composition of each blend is similar to the previous one.
These carefully selected blends are then packed as Bulk(in paper sacks or PP bags), or packaged in cartons/ pouches bearing your brand name & Logo(as per your requirements) and shipped to you as per your order.
